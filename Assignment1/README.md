# Zipf's Law Verification

In simple terms it states the frequency of a word is inversely propotional to its rank, Following images summaries it.

## Conclsion
- Nearly 37% of the text comprises of Vowels. 
- Distribution of the letter is different from the distribution of the words. 
- The distributution of letter buldges out more than the distribution of the Lettes. 
- They reasons for this may be there are around ~ 70000 word but there are only 26 alphabets. 
- "e" and "t" have the highest frequency because word "the" also had highest frequency and it contains both e and t. 
- "and" was also among the frequent word that's why "a" and "n" is also among the most frequent letter. 
- zipf's law is not an exact fit for the frequency and rank relation. 
- According to the Zipf's law a straight line is the best fit for log(frequency) and log(rank), as per the observation from the above, a parabola can be a good fit.
